# Data Engineer Test - Patty Lau

This repository contains the answers for the Data Engineer Test. The answers are divided into four parts: SQL and Data Modeling, ETL Pipeline on Airflow, Cloud Infrastructure and Containerization, and Simple (but hard) Voting System.

## SQL and Data Modeling

The `trip_sql.md` file contains the SQL queries and data modeling for the trip data provided.

## ETL Pipeline on Airflow

The `airflow-test` folder contains the solution for the ETL Pipeline on Airflow question. The folder contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run the pipeline.

## Cloud Infrastructure and Containerization

The `airflow-test` folder also contains the solution for the Cloud Infrastructure and Containerization question. The `README.md` file in the folder explains how to deploy and run the Airflow pipeline on a cloud infrastructure using Docker.

## Simple (but hard) Voting System

The `voting-system` folder contains the solution for the Simple (but hard) Voting System question. The folder contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run the system.

Each folder contains a separate `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run the solution for that question.

## Dependencies

The solutions require the following dependencies:

- SQL and Data Modeling: None
- ETL Pipeline on Airflow: Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL
- Cloud Infrastructure and Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL
- Simple (but hard) Voting System: Python, Sanic, PostgreSQL, Docker, Docker Compose

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the solutions.
